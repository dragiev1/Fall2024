	I knew computer science was what I wanted to do in my future because since I was a kid I always loved to create, design, and mold all sorts of things. As I am graduating in the Spring 2025 semester, I have completed a large portion of my degree already. Currently, I am enrolled in machine learning, mathematics for machine learning, complex analysis, and cyber security. As well as auditing in Abstract Algebra for fun. 
 	I have had mild experiences in an internship over the last half of the summer and feel confident that I will do well in this course despite the rush it is. In my internship, we utilized vue/vite and typeScript, as well as nodeJS and other similar languages and technologies we will be using. We created a website that administrators for companies can use, no matter the size, to monitor employees, create and assign tasks to employees, and many more features enough to fill the rest of this page. I could tell you more about it if interested! I also audited in your class in the Spring of 2024 semester, so I like to think I have a good foundation of what to expect and am ready to take on the challenge. I do believe this class will be extremely essential to honing my skills as a developer so that way I can be more comfortable building things I want to create. Especially in the future internships or (hopefully) jobs I acquire.
